# Happy Backending

Happy Backending is a YouTube channel that covers topics related to software development, particularly focusing on the backend. The channel is managed by me, but there might be collaborations with other developers in the future. The main themes include REST API development, database management, CI/CD techniques, and much more.

# HCryproPriceBot

HCryptoPriceBot is a Telegram bot that allows users to view cryptocurrency prices. The bot was developed in Python using the python-telegram-bot library. It can display price variations in different timeframes and charts from both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. A REST API is currently being developed to track calls, limit bot usage in certain chats, and provide statistics.
